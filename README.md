Back in 2009, I was spending a bit more time on IRC and I really wanted to take a stab at writing a bot.  I had been coding
in c# for a couple years at this point, but I'd never tried tackling asynchronous network I/O with threading, so making a bot
scratched that itch for me.

This code may not be the best, but it exists as a reminder that sometimes you need to just write a project when you want to
learn a new technique.
